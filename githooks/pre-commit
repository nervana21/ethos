# === Ethos git hook shim ===
#
# This hook is intentionally minimal and delegates to `prek`, which is
# configured via the repository-level `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
#
# Recommended setup:
#   1. Install prek (for example on macOS/Linux):
#        brew install prek
#   2. Install git hooks:
#        prek install
#
# After that, `.git/hooks/pre-commit` will be managed directly by `prek`.
# This file remains as a fallback shim for environments that still call it.
